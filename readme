# Server Health Check

A bash script to monitor health metrics of multiple remote servers via SSH.

## Features

- System uptime monitoring
- Disk usage tracking (root partition)
- Memory utilization stats
- SSH security audit (failed login attempts)
- Logging to temporary file
- Automatic cleanup on exit

## Requirements

- SSH access to target servers
- Bash shell
- Standard Unix utilities (df, free, awk, grep)

## Usage

```bash
./server_health_check.sh -f <server_list_file> -u <remote_user>
```

### Options

- `-f` : Path to file containing server list (one per line)
- `-u` : Remote SSH username
- `-h` : Display help

### Server List Format

Create a text file with one server per line:
```
server1.example.com
192.168.1.10
server2.example.com
# Comments are ignored
```

## Example

```bash
./server_health_check.sh -f servers.txt -u admin
```

## Output

The script creates a temporary log file in `/tmp/server_health.XXXXXX` and displays results in real-time. The log file is automatically deleted on exit.
